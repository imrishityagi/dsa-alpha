public class javaLoops {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // if we want to do some repetative task in our program then we use loops there.
      // for eg. if we want to print hello world 3 times then we can do this
      System.out.println("Hello World");
      System.out.println("Hello World");
      System.out.println("Hello World");  

      // but let suppose if we have to print hello world 500 times then if will be very difficult to write so long code of 500 lines only to print hello world
      // so here comes loops in rescue where we can do out repetative task in few lines of code
      // loops helps us in saving our time and also increase performance as well as readability of the code.
      // in java we have 3 types of loops:
      //   1. while Loop       // used where we don't know the number of iterations
      //   2. for Loop         // used where we know exact number of iterations
      //   3. do while Loop    // similar as while but execute atleast one time if condition become 
                               // false in first iteration.
    }
}

// notes: we also have infinite loops in every programming language. write a infinite loop very cleverly
// for eg:
  // while(true) {
  //   System.out.println("Hello World");
  // }
// this is a bad thing because this loop will never terminate
